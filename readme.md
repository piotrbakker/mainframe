# Framez

Framez is a framework for naming product design artifacts in Figma.

## Projects

Project names are either specific, related to a narrowly focused aspect of a product’s design (e.g., onboarding, activation, navigation, etc.) or general, suitable for covering a wide-range of design disciplines (e.g., information architecture, usability, interaction design, etc.). Project names follow [title case formatting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

## Files

File names are composed of the following elements:

```
[file category] [product name] [project name] [branch name]
```

Commonly used file categories include:

* Wires — low-fidelity wireframes & sketches;
* Visual — high-fidelity mockups;
* Library — separate shared style & component repositories;
* System — multiple shared style & component repositories organized into a single file.

### Examples

```
Wires Framez Web Landing 2020-01
Visual Framez Web Account 2020-01
Library Framez Web Icons Main
System Framez Web Main
```

## Pages

Page names follow [title case formatting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

## Frames

Where possible, Frames should inherit the corresponding page names, appended by key technical information, such as width, aspect ratio, grid properties, and round of iterations. Sequential numbering should be avoided to reduce clutter. 

### Examples

```
Framez Newsletter 768px Col-12 r1
Framez Newsletter 1024px Col-12 r2
Framez iOS App 4.7in Col-4 r1
Framez iOS App 5.8in Col-4 r2
