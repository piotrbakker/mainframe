# Framez

Framez is a framework for naming product design artifacts in Figma.

## Principles

* In general, follow [title case formatting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).
* Separate title values with hyphens.
* Separate component and style values with slashes.
* Express dates according to the [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) notation: [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD] or [YYYY]-[MM].
* Avoid sequential numbering to reduce clutter. 

## Projects

Project names are either specific, related to a narrowly focused aspect of a product’s design (e.g., onboarding, activation, navigation, etc.) or general, suitable for covering a wide-range of design disciplines (e.g., information architecture, usability, interaction design, etc.).

## Files

File names are composed of the following elements:

```
[File Category] - [Product Name] - [Project Name] - [Branch Name]
```

Commonly used file categories include:

* Wires — low-fidelity wireframes & sketches;
* Visual — high-fidelity mockups;
* Library — separate shared style & component repositories;
* System — multiple shared style & component repositories organized into a single file.
